### Browsers:

* [Safari] v11.1
* [Chrome] v70.0

### What was left out?

`There should be also total profit for a particular year or both years together (based on selection).`

The above part in the set of tasks was left out, partially because I'm not sure I understood well enough.


Every other thing has been implemented.

Also made some changes in the `urls.py` file because of the error I was getting after a change has been made to any of the components.
